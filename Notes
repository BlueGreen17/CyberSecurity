For user privileges:
1. -w  means write operation.
2. -r means read operation.
3. -x means execute operation.

Chmod modes:
To remove all permissions for group and world you would type chmod 700 [filename]. 
To give the owner all permissions and world execute you would type chmod 701 [filename].
To give the owner all permissions and world read and execute you would type chmod 705.

rwx" stands for Read, Write, and Execute permissions.
The first "rwx" represents permissions for the file owner.
The "------" part represents that there are no permissions granted to the group and others.

So, breaking it down:

"rwx" for the owner means the owner has read, write, and execute permissions on the file.
"------" for group and others means no permissions are granted to the group or any other users.

By salting:
We associate a random number with each user password.

Operating system sets up passwords as cryptographic one way hashes in a password file or database.

In Linux systems, encrypted passwords are typically stored in the location “/etc/shadow”
In FreeBSD systems, encrypted passwords are typically stored in the location “/etc/master.passwd”

Both heap and stack are essential to implement recursion
In the structure of a typical memory layout of program, the stack segment grows towards the higher memory address
The executable instructions of a program are usually stored in the data segment

Fork System Calls creates child processes.
